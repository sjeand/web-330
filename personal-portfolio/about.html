    <h2>About</h2>

    <p>
      Hello! My name is Sarah Jean Baptiste. I am an aspiring front-end web developer. While I love coding and learning new languages, my heart will always belong to design! I was born with a paint brush in my hand and being creative brings me joy. When I'm not coding, I am spending time with my family. My Husband and I have been married for five years and have a three year old daughter. Our daughter is too smart and beyond sassy, so we are always busy. When we have time we love to travel, especially to the Caribbean.
